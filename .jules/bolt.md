# 2025-05-15 - Broken Search Deferral & Optimized Initials Utility

**Learning:** React 19's `useDeferredValue` is a powerful tool for maintaining input responsiveness during heavy filtering, but it requires consistent variable naming across the component to avoid `ReferenceError` and logic failures. Additionally, using a single optimized regex match (`/(?:^|[._\-\s])(\w)/g`) for extracting initials is more efficient than chaining `split`, `filter`, and `map`, as it minimizes array allocations and iterations.
**Action:** Always verify that deferred values are correctly referenced in `useMemo` dependency arrays. Use targeted regex patterns for string extraction tasks to reduce main-thread overhead in frequently rendered components like user profile sections.

## 2026-04-05 - Pre-allocating Intl.DateTimeFormat for 50x speedup

**Learning:** Repeatedly calling `toLocaleTimeString` or `toLocaleDateString` on `Date` objects incurs significant overhead from locale parsing and formatter initialization. Pre-allocating a static `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance and using its `.format()` method is ~50x faster (~30ms vs ~1500ms for 10k ops in benchmark).
**Action:** Always pre-allocate `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for frequently called formatting tasks. When used for HH:MM:SS, explicitly set `hour: '2-digit', minute: '2-digit', second: '2-digit'` and `hour12: false` to ensure cross-platform consistency and avoid 12/24h toggle regressions.

## 2026-05-20 - Search Input Double-Memoization

**Learning:** Implementing "double-memoization" for search inputs—normalizing the raw query (trim, lowercase) in a `useMemo` *before* passing it to `useDeferredValue`—is significantly more efficient than normalizing inside the filtering `useMemo`. This prevents `useDeferredValue` from triggering a low-priority render cycle entirely when the user only types or deletes whitespace, saving redundant O(N) filter iterations.
**Action:** Always normalize search state in a dedicated `useMemo` before deferring or using it in expensive computation chains to filter out functional no-ops.
